# Coding Principles

* *Think product-wide* - Developing any feature think how it will be used now, who will use it, and how it may be transformed in the future.
* *Working concept first* - Focus on the working concept of the feature first before starting journey to the ideal code structure.
* *Consistency* - Keep variable names, structures, approaches, styles same across the whole project.
* *Least astonishment* - Make your code, UI, UX unsurprising
* *Keep It Simple (KISS)* - The simpler your code is, the easier it is to construct and maintain.
* *You Aren’t Gonna Need It (YAGNI)*
* *Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)* - Remember, OverDRYing may break KISS principles. Sometimes, readability and clearness are better than complexity.
* *Validate your data* - Any incoming data should be validated and/or filtered.
* *Always Test Your Code*
